Fork of Cubic theme (see: readme_cubic.txt) for experimentation and customisation for eveningdim.com.

Current suggested method for getting pushed changes onto remote server:

1) Note down the changes to be committed and pushed - i.e. what files are added with `git add`.
2) Commit and push to GitHub.
3) Use SFTP client of choice to move altered files from local onto remote.
